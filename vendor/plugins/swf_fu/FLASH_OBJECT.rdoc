== Compatibility with FlashObject

This document is intended for users of FlashObject, a (much older) swf embedding plugin that inspired swf_fu.

You can choose to:

1) keep both. They won't interfere and +flashobject_tag+ will continue to use the older SWFObject 1.5 library.

2) remove FlashObject:

  script/plugin remove flashobject_helper

You can also manually remove <tt>javascripts/flashobject.js</tt>

+swf_fu+ will take over the +flashobject_tag+ and will use the new SWFObject 2.2 library.
This should not have impacts as long as:
* your swf path is absolute (e.g. "/path/to/my_flash.swf"). If it is relative, move your swf file from 'public/' to the new 'public/swfs/' asset folder
* you include the default javascripts (otherwise you need to include 'swfobject' explicitely and stop including 'flashobject')
* you don't use the javascript object before the page is loaded. SWFObject 2.2 makes the changes to the web page later
* you don't rely on the +verify_file_exists+ option (it doesn't do anything anymore)

In either case 1 or 2, you change existing calls to +flashobject_tag+ for +swf_tag+ at your leisure.
The interface is similar and the main differences are some options name changes:
  :flash_id  => :id
  :variables => :flashvars
  :background_color => options[:parameters][:bgcolor]

Moreover, the following defaults are gone:
  :flashvars[:lzproxied]
  :parameters[:scale]
  :parameters[:bgcolor]
