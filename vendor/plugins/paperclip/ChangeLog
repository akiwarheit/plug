* Introducing `:restricted_characters` in Paperclip::Attachment.default_options
  so people can override their blacklist characters by override that setting.

* Paperclip will now replace all the special characters in the filename to an
  underscore. This is a more desired behavior against having to deal with URL
  escaping and unescaping later. You can see the list of blacklist characters
  in `lib/paperclip/attachment.rb`
